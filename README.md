# proj1-bremorse_R

- Learning how to create graphs over a set of data, concerning Bremorse.
- Visualizing the graphs into a similar graph as seen in the Economist: https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*9GzHVtm4y_LeVmFCjqV3Ww.png. Practiced creating both graphs but have only inserted the left graph.

Skills demonstrated: 
- Used tidyverse to read/analyze data and plot graphs.
- Used ggthemes to change the graphs to the requested 'economist' theme.
